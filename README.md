### Hey there ✌️ I am Gor Matevosyan, Data Scientist from Armenia.

As a data scientist based in Yerevan, Armenia, my focus is on projects related to Digital Signal Processing, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. I have extensive experience in AI/ML research and data science, having worked as a Lead AI/ML Research Scientist at Podcastle AI and a Data Scientist at Teamable, where I led and contributed to complex projects involving Text-to-Speech, Speech Enhancement, Voice Cloning, job-candidate matching, and Computer Vision. Additionally, I have experience teaching Deep Learning and Neural Networks as a part-time Lecturer at Russian-Armenian University.
